                    <h3>Lab 5 Journal Questions & Answers</h3>
                    
                    <h4>1. How is storing data in a JSON file different from using browser storage?</h4>
                    <p>JSON files are cross-platform and version controlled. They are saved as physical files that can be accessed by several applications. Browser storage is device-specific, limited to 5-10MB, and only available through JavaScript inside the same browser.</p>
                  
                    <h4>2. How did you use Python to create or update your JSON file?</h4>
                    <p>In order to handle the JSON file intelligently, save_entry.py was created. It reads current entries, adds new ones with automated timestamps, and safely writes everything back with correct formatting and error handling for reliability.</p>
                    
                    <h4>3. What does your PWA show locally, and what will users see on GitHub? Are they the same? Why or why not?</h4>
                    <p>When Python adds entries, live JSON updates are displayed in local development. GitHub Pages pauses JSON during commit time because it only serves static files and does no backend processing. They remain in sync because of the manual commits.</p>
                    
                    <h4>4. What extra feature did you add to your PWA using the JSON file, and why?</h4>
                    <p>Added an interactive statistics dashboard that counts and categorises data based on its source (JSON, Local, or Static). This clearly displays the Python-JS data flow and offers instant feedback when new entries are added, enhancing both functionality and learning experience.</p>

                    <div class="entry-actions">

                    <h3>Which Storage, Browser, and Third-Party APIs did you choose, and why?</h3>
                    <p><strong>Storage API:</strong> Enhanced local storage for journal entries and theme choices, including Session Storage as a backup option. It was chosen for its simplicity and widespread browser support.</p>
                    <p><strong>Browser API:</strong> Clipboard API for copying journal entries and improved Validation API for form validation. These considerably improve the overall user experience.</p>
                    <p><strong>Third-Party API:</strong> The YouTube Player API allows you to connect with educational videos. We choose video content since it improves the learning experience.</p>
                    
                    <h3>How did you integrate each API with DOM manipulation?</h3>
                    <p><strong>Storage API:</strong> localStorage.setItem() saves data and then dynamically builds DOM elements on load.</p>
                    <p><strong>Clipboard API:</strong> Added copy buttons to journal entries that use navigator.clipboard.writeText() and provide visual feedback.</p>
                    <p><strong>YouTube API:</strong> YT.Player() generates embedded video, custom buttons manage player using API functions.</p>
                    
                    <h3>What challenges did you encounter, and how did you solve them?</h3>
                    <p><strong>Clipboard API permissions:</strong> Some browsers require a secure context (HTTPS). Error handling and backup messages were included.</p>
                    <p><strong>YouTube API loading:</strong> The API script needed to load before being initialised. I used the onYouTubeIframeAPIReady callback.</p>
                    <p><strong>Overlapping buttons:</strong> Stop button moved off-screen; corrected with CSS Grid and responsive layouts.</p>
                    
                    <h3>In what ways do these APIs improve your Learning Journal PWA?</h3>
                    <p><strong>Persistence:</strong> When the browser is closed, users' entries and preferences are saved.</p>
                    <p><strong>Usability:</strong> One-click copying and quick form response.</p>
                    <p><strong>Rich Content:</strong> Video integration improves learning.</p>
                    <p><strong>Professional appearance:</strong> Native app experience with smooth interactions.</p>

                    <h3>Which DOM selection methods did you use, and why did you choose them?</h3>
                    <p>I used getElementById() for single items such as the live date and theme toggle because it is quick and precise. Due to its flexibility and ability to take CSS selectors, I also utilised querySelectorAll() for many items, such as collapsable sections.</p>
                    
                    <h3>What was the most challenging part about linking JavaScript with your HTML?</h3>
                    <p>The most difficult aspect was ensuring that the JavaScript loaded at the appropriate time and that all DOM elements were available when the scripts attempted to access them. This timing issue was resolved by using the DOMContentLoaded event.</p>
                    
                    <h3>How did you test and debug your JavaScript code?</h3>
                    <p>I used browser developer tools extensively, including console.log for debugging data, the Elements tab for checking DOM structure, and for myself testing all interactive features on various screen sizes to verify responsiveness.</p>

                    <h3>Mobile-First Design Approach</h3>
                    <p>I began by designing with mobile devices in mind, utilising a layout with one column that eventually expands on larger screens. This method ensured that the essential content and functionality worked flawlessly on reduced viewports.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Most Useful HTML/CSS Concept</h3>
                    <p>The CSS Flexbox concept was the most helpful one I used to create responsive layout structures and navigation. With Flexbox, creating flexible components that adjust to various screen sizes without requiring intricate computations was simple.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Most Challenging Aspect</h3>
                    <p>The hardest things for me were choosing a breakpoint and media queries. To enable smooth transitions between layouts, the ideal breakpoints for various devices needed to be tested and adjusted.</p>
